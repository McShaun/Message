                		<p>
                        Finally, today, the Lord will use yet another parable of genes to speak about the Rapture of the spirit and body. This portion will be delivered by the Lord Himself. He will give you important Word that is to the point, so I hope that you will listen well.
						</p>
                    <blockquote><p>
                    <strong>John 5:24</strong> "Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life."
                    	</p>
                        <p>
                    <strong>1 Cor 15:46</strong> "The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual."
                    </p>

                    	<h3>The Lord's Words</h3>
                        <p>
                        I will explain this by using the parable of genes again. From what do the Y-chromosome sperm and the X-chromosome sperm receive the strength to penetrate the membrane of the egg? The sperm carrying genes are produced because of love. Likewise, because God, the Holy Spirit, and I, Jesus, love you extremely, you have been led to 'the gospel,' you have met the one I sent in this time period--who takes action as my body--and you have come to this history. As a result, you have come to meet Me, Jesus, who is the Bridegroom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
You should listen to the Word of the Complete Testament, the Word of the Advent and of the Rapture that I preach through the one I sent and you should firmly believe it and put it into action. You need to fulfill all your responsibilities in this way and exert the greatest power, that is, 'the power of love.' Only then can you break down all the tribulations, persecution, doubt, adversities, slanderers, and the working of Satan of this time period, only then can you penetrate <a href="#1">that membrane[1]</a> and enter, and only then can you become one with the person that I sent as my body.

    		<p>This time when you hold 'the wedding banquet at the bride's home' on earth, in other words, when you fulfill the physical rapture, is a time in which you must equip your spirit to be in its 100% perfect form, which belongs to Heaven. What should you equip your spirit with? To put it in simple terms: do not love anyone else leaving Me, Jesus, on the side but believe and follow only Me 100%. This is equipping yourself 100%.
            </p>
			<p>
100% is an easy thing to accomplish. If a woman gives up everything else and loves only one man, isn't this 100%? If she doesn't do so, will the man accept her? If you follow Me while giving your heart and your body to someone else, putting Me, Jesus, who is the King of kings, to the side, can you become My love? I am telling you to love Me, Jesus, more than your beloved husband or wife, and more than anything you love. I mean that you should live making Me, Jesus, your top priority.
			</p>
            <p>
I have first raptured your body and spirit on earth in order to transform your spirit into the heavenly form. Everyone, pray and become one with Me, Jesus, so that your own spirit will transform into the heavenly form perfectly. Right now, I am looking for people who will do this. Just as an orchard keeper only picks fruit that are ripe and not rotten from the fruit trees and puts them aside, which the owner comes, picks up and carries away in a vehicle; when the archangel blows the trumpet and I, Jesus, return, I will rapture only the spirits who have already been prepared and set aside, and take them to Heaven.

            I, Jesus, am continuously giving you revelations for the sake of your spirit's rapture while I am departing for the Advent. I am leaving, speaking to you with the heart of a man who bids farewell to his beloved woman and makes a sincere request that she be perfectly ready, as he leaves for a distant foreign country. My heart is like that of a man who wants his lover to receive him and go with him when he comes back from the foreign country, but he is anxious, worrying that she will fail to prepare because of misunderstandings and thus fail to receive him. With an anxious heart, he draws a map and explains things to her as he is leaving.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am the Lord Jesus who has spoken in detail about the Rapture of the body and spirit through parables. Shalom!
